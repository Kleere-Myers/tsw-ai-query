# Project Overview

The **TSW AI Query Platform** is a hosted, multi-tenant SaaS application that enables
employees of Time Share companies to ask business questions in natural language and
receive governed, read-only results from the TimeShareWare (TSW) database.

The system translates plain-English questions into SQL that is:
- **Safe** (SELECT-only)
- **Governed** (subject areas, column policies, business rules)
- **Auditable** (every step logged)
- **Explainable** (rules and logic visible)

This is not a generic chatbot.
It is a controlled analytics interface designed for trust, compliance,
and operational reporting.
