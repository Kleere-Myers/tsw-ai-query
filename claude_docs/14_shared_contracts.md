# Shared Contracts (Backend ↔ Frontend)

This document defines canonical request/response shapes.

## Rules
- Backend and frontend must stay in sync
- IDs are opaque where possible
- Backend enforces permissions and masking

Contracts include:
- Start query
- Clarify
- Execute
- Export
- History
- Admin CRUD

Refer to TypeScript interfaces for exact shapes.
