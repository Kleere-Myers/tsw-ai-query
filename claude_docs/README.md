# Claude Project Documentation – TSW AI Query Platform

This directory is the **authoritative knowledge base** for the TSW AI Query Platform.

These documents are intended to be read by:
- Human developers
- AI coding assistants (Claude Code)

Claude Code is expected to:
- Read these documents **before writing or modifying code**
- Treat them as source-of-truth for architecture, contracts, and constraints
- Ask clarifying questions when information is missing
- Avoid inventing schema, rules, or behavior not described here

This system is a **multi-tenant, governed, read-only analytics platform**
for employees of Time Share companies using the TimeShareWare (TSW) database.
